# Problem Description 

  To empirically analyze several sorting algorithms and determine which is most effective (fastest) 
  given the challenges (code length, time taken to code, bugs, etc.). The goal is to compare Selection,
  merge, insertion, quick, tree, heap, bubble, and Linux sort methods. This will be performed by 
  creating a list generator that generates a list of random numbers and pipes that list into each sort
  method. Given different amount of list length, our objective is to empirically analyze the different
  times that each sort produces.
